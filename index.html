        <p>Hello this is a simple vanilla js pwa with a markdown blog</p>
        <p>It only uses VanillaJS, Fetch API, Snarkdown(simple light md parser) and your browser.</p>


        <articles>
          <h3>What it uses?</h3>
          <p>It only uses pure, plain, simple vanilla JavaScript!, A bit of CSS! HTML just for... you know, works on browser. LOL</p>

          <h3>How it is made?</h3>
          <p>No pre/post/wibbly-wobbly processor for <em><strong>ANYTHING</strong></em></p>
          <p> It is just simple as:
            <ol>
              <li>A JSON file describing post's name and file</li>
              <li>A JS to know whether to show the post's list or the post articles, based on anchor #id-of-section. As if it was a 'native pwa'.</li>
              <li>A JS to know when the #id-of-section is in use to: 
                <ol>
                  <li>Valide the url after the hash to know if it renders the post's list or the post</li>
                  <li>Get the list of post based on the json file</li>
                  <li>Get the post content</li>
                  <li>Parse and render the markdown content into html</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Fetch API for request both json file and the post article file when it's requested. <small>In order to simplify its use, i'm using a fetch api wrapper, pure js also.</small></li>
              <li>A Simple, light, fast markdown parser. I've use <a href="https://github.com/developit/snarkdown">Snarkdown</a> </li>
              <li>Coffee</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
           <p> Oh wait, that is in fact how it was.</p>
         

          <p>Looking up in the source files here you will see, i got these structure:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>/assets
              <dl>
                <dt>/blog</dt>
                <dd>Here is the folder where i save all the <em><b>.md</b></em> files.</dd>
                <dt>blog.json</dt>
                <dd>Here is a simple json object with the post's array, each object has the properties: title (for showing) and name (the file name to request)</dd>
              </dl>
            </li>
            <li>/scripts
              <dl>
                <dt>blog.js</dt>
                <dd>The one who takes care of the blog rendering, fetching, parsing and so on.</dd>

                <dt>content.js</dt>
                <dd>The one who takes care of what it shows on page (i'm current using because i made this example based on what i used on my website)</dd>

                <dt>Request.js</dt>
                <dd>The fatch api wrapper to simplify the code</dd>

                <dt>snarkdown.js</dt>
                <dd>The markdown parser</dd>
              </dl>
            </li>
            <li>/style</li>
            <li>index.html</li>
            <li>main.js</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
    
        <articles>
        <h3>How to use?</h3>
        <p>If you want to use it as i used or if you want to use it as initial idea to improve it as you need, you will have to:</p>
        <p>Copy these whole source, really, all here, just copy, adjust the css as you need. Made the blog.html you indes.html.</p>
        <p>You will have to do 3 important things exactly the same:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Have the assets folder inside root folder</li>
          <li>Have the blog folder inside assets folder</li>
          <li>Have the blog.json file inside assets folder</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Than you just import the content module and init it, as in <code>main.js</code>, it's really, really simple, has no secret or magic at all.

        <h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I know, i know...</p>
<blockquote>We already have a tons of static generators: gatsby, jenkyll, hugo, next, bla bla bla bla</blockquote>

<p>
But, i'm not a framework person, and i am not saying they're bad, i just dont think that a i need aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllll of it just ot make a simple blog. And in fact i didn't.
You can see, i used, 3 to 6 files just for make the blog.
NO FREAKING NODE MODULES, NO FECKING FRAMEWORKER BUNDLERS.
An i even minified it or make a bundle, and it is fast enought to me.
</p>
<p>
I'm not trying to remake the whell here, i just wanted to make it on the core.
</p>
</p>
<p>
I was not build for be a large scale tool, i was not build for be a big stuff.
</p>
<p>
I just made it because of my curiosity, and i think that i may be useful for someone.
</p>
<p>

Thanks if you read till here.
